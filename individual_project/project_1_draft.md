### Introduction: 
Participation of women in workforce across the globe has been on the downturn for quite some time now. It may come as a surprise when we take a broad view of the subject because on the outside it seems as the world is developing very rapidly with tech-giants taking over our everyday lives, mordernization in cultures around the world, eradication of backward or gender discriminating practices, greater acceptance or  etc. but when we delve deeper we come to know that there are lesser percentage of women in the work-force than there were in the 1990's. Quite shocking right? So let's dig a little deeper and have a look at what has been the trend of women in the labor-force across the globe and which countries have the highest participation of women population in the workforce.
